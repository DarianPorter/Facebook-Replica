# Mugbook

Mugbook is a facebook look-alike single-page web app using *Ruby on Rails* on the back-end and *React Redux* on the front-end, replicating Facebook’s feature of being able to sign in and make posts from your account. Mugbook takes direct styling ques from facebook, from it's login/sign-up page, timeline and userpage, almost to be indistinguishable from its source of inspiration at first glance.

## Background and Overview

#### Motovation for the Project
    I wanted to choose a social media platform that I was very fimilar with and had a lot of experience using, so when it came to implimenting features I would have a prior knowledge on how said feature worked and would have a vague understanding on how it was implimented.
    Also, I wanted something that someone could pick up and be fimilar with, from prior experience or exposure to actual facebook.

#### High Level Overview
    Build a clone of facebook down to styling with implimentation of spefic features
